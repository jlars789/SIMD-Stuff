# SIMD-Stuff
Implementations of SIMD from Luther Tychonievich's CS3330 Sp22 Class

SIMD means ***S***ingle ***I***nstruction ***M***ultiple ***D***ata. It is a method of processor optimization where we use a vector of data and perform an operation on different portions of it, speeding the sequence of instructions significantly. 

This repository contains a few examples of these. I do not own *all* of this code, but the SIMD functionality is created by me. I also do not endorse the use of this repository for academic solutions.
